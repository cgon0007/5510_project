We think that the <strong>Hospitality industry</strong> is currently being affected immensely due to COVID-19
and as so it is important to investigate the driving forces behind hotel bookings and extract
meaningful patterns. This analysis might prove useful for executives in the
<strong>Hospitality industry</strong> to adjust their business plans.
However, the dataset can also provide valuable insight to customers by helping them take an
informative decision before booking their accommodation.<br>
At this point it is important to establish that the dataset contains information for bookings
in two hotels located in <strong>Portugal</strong>, with one of them being a resort hotel located
in Algarve and the other a city hotel located in Lisbon. <br>Although, the dataset contains data for only
one country, under certain conditions our analysis and results might expand to hotels in other regions,
especially those that target simillar customers with Portugal.<br>

In total it has <strong>40,060</strong> observations for H1 and <strong>79,330</strong> observations for H2, with each observation representing a hotel booking.
The bookings are regarding the period between 1st of July of 2015 and the
31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were
canceled. The city hotel is located in Lisbon and the resort in Algarve. The rest of the

<li>lead_time variable: How many days before the expected arrival the booking was
canceled.</li>
<li>previous_cancellations:Number of previous bookings that were cancelled by the
customer prior to the current booking.</li>
<li>Previous_bookings_not_canceled : Number of previous bookings not cancelled by
the customer prior to the current booking</li>
<li>customer _type: Contract - when the booking has
<li> 4 variables indicating the time of the booking: arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month,
arrival_date_week_number, arrival_date_day_of_month</li>
<li> 3 variables regarding the number of people that made the reservation: adults,
children, babies</li>
<li>The Country variable indicates from where the booking was made</li>
<li>The adr variable represents the average daily rate paid to the hotel</li>

type of room and changes requested.</li> </ul>
